# Changelog

This document contains the full history of Fever.

Note that this repository's codebase only contains a copy of v1.39 and onwards.

## v1.41 (2023-08-27)

- Add support to optionally check for updates from GitHub:
	- This feature will only check for an update. It will _not_ update your installation.
	- If the global constant `FEVER_GITHUB_REPOSITORY` is defined (`<owner>/<repo>`), Fever will check the latest release from the given GitHub repository via the GitHub REST API.
	- The optional global constant `FEVER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN ` can be used to extend the rate limit.
	- These two constants can be added to one of your configuration files (`config/db.php` or `config/key.php`).
- Replace URL to `feedafever.com/anon/` with `rel="noreferrer"` attribute
- Replace URL to `todone.txt` with URL to `CHANGELOG.md` at GitHub repository
- Fix user agent sniffing:
	- Some browsers (such as Firefox) on mobile/tablet devices might not include the `AppleWebKit` segment but might instead include a `Mobile` or `Tablet` platform segment.
- Fix mobile portrait detection:
	- Replace deprecated event `Window:orientationchange` with `ScreenOrientation:change`.
	- Replace portrait detection to compare width against height instead of looking for specific (outdated) widths.
- Add Laravel Valet environment file (`.valetrc`)
- Clean-up quoted and interpolated strings

	- Indent doc strings supported by PHP 7.3

## v1.39 (2014-09-22)

- updated mobile CSS for the iPhones 6
- fix for `html:` namespacing prefix throwing off entity decoding in Atom feeds
- improved gateway connectivity error reporting
- "reload interface after browser refresh" now defaults to off because I'm tired of getting support requests about the default behavior
- added feeds to the list of database tables regularly optimized and repaired
- now explicitly closes database connection before exiting


## v1.38 (2014-02-10)

- fixed bug where only the first PDO-powered MySQL query would work (affected a tiny fraction of servers)
- added PHP 5.1 requirement for PDO support (required for, at least, query & fetch)
- optimized all PNGs with http://imageoptim.com (update archive down from 1.3MB to 1.1MB)


## v1.37 (2014-02-05)

- fixed PHP 4.x SIDB fatal errors (due to using PHP 5-only control structures)


## v1.36 (2014-02-05)

- reports anonymous server capabilities to feedafever.com during gateway requests so I can make informed decisions about future development
	data collected (see `Fever->capabilities()` for implementation):
	- `fever_version`
	- `php_version`
	- `mysql_client_version`
	- `mysql_server_version`
	- `has_pdo_mysql`
	- `has_mysqli`
	- `has_mysql`
	- `has_iconv`
	- `has_mbstring`
	- `has_gd_png`
	- `has_curl`
- removed use of deprecated e flag with `preg_replace`
- increased request timeout when requesting updates to accommodate the larger zip (caused by @2x assets)
- added SIDB to eliminate dependency on the deprecated `mysql_*` family of functions
- removed two lingering `allow_call_time_pass_reference` errors
- fixed a problem with links never heating up on OS X Mavericks Server


## v1.35 (2014-01-27)

- dummied out desktop refresh functions in mobile JavaScript to eliminate undefined errors
- only links `override.css` or `override-mobile.css` if they exist
- manually added `@2x` assets with `@media` query--like a schlep
- removed automatic `.htaccess` retinafication technique


## v1.34 (2014-01-25)

- STOPGAP: deleted retinafication .htaccess file on problem servers

	If you updated to 1.33 and images or CSS now 404, you
	have a problem server. I believe the problem involves
	`mod_rewrite`'s default RewriteBase or possibly Apache's
	include paths. Not sure how to fix just yet. Manually
	defining the RewriteBase to the expected value results
	in 500 errors in problem servers. Hence this stopgap.


## v1.33 (2014-01-24)


- added ?mobile query to force the mobile view on non-mobile (or unsupported) devices
- added retina support to desktop and mobile views
- added hooks for persistent style customization

	Just add an `override.css` or `override-mobile.css` to the root `fever/` directory.
	Copy selectors from existing CSS and use `!important` where necessary.
	NOTE: Persists through updates but otherwise unsupported.


## v1.32 (2014-01-16)


- added support for `media:credit` (mapped to item author)
- fixed missing space in curl options on Extras page
- removed `-webkit-text-size-adjust` from desktop stylesheets (Safari/Chrome resize should now match Firefox)


## v1.31 (2013-04-14)


- reverted to original "reload interface after browser refresh" behavior until I have time to revisit properly (can still be disabled entirely in your Fever Preferences under the Refreshing tab)


## v1.30 (2013-04-14)


- updated cURL cron example to include single quotes around the refresh url (absence causes problems on some hosts)
- rewrote encoding handling for non-UTF-8 feeds
- added a special case for rel="hub" links in Atom feeds


## v1.29 (2013-04-13)

## v1.13
 (bug fixes)
- reverted to original "back out of group/feed" behavior (the last few items would never be marked as read since you have to scroll to the top to back out)

Feeds that were brought to my attention that now work properly (or better) in Fever 1.11:

Feeds that were brought to my attention that now work properly (or better) in Fever 1.08:

- http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/index.atom
- http://bitworking.org/news/feed/
- http://blog.tagesanzeiger.ch/mamablog/index.php/feed/atom/


## v1.07

- iPhone: added preliminary support for automatic background refreshing on the iPhone--current implementation may not refresh the stalest feeds--will revisit if necessary (uses `ignore_user_abort(true)` to continue with refresh request without maintaining a persistent connection)
- iPhone: added limited Feedlet support to iPhone version
- marking Spark items as read no longer incorrectly decrements the total unread count displayed in Kindling and the browser title bar (since Sparks don't contribute to these numbers)
- Fever now ignores this broken png favicon to prevent choking the caching process: http://www.imjustcreative.com/favicon.ico
- rewrote `blacklist()` to eliminate dropped connections when modifying the blacklist
- updated Fever's query functions to free up memory wherever possible
- Fever now manually removes `<style>` elements (and their contents) before using PHP's native `strip_tags()` (which unhelpfully removes the tag but not the CSS code it contained)
- rewrote `weight_links()` method to perform far fewer updates each refresh (up to 90% fewer in common situations)
- ?feedlet&js request now sent with the proper `content-type: text/javascript`
- fixed typo ("ellapsed") in debug output
- added -k option to the example curl resquest on the Extras page when served over https (this allows curl to accept self-signed certificates)

Feeds that were brought to my attention that now work properly in Fever 1.07:

- `feed://apelad.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default`
- http://feeds2.feedburner.com/imjustcreative (favicon was wrecking havoc with Fever's favicon caching routine)


## v1.06

- iPhone: added support for swiping to the previous/next item
- if a group or feed with no unread has focus and "Show read" is disabled then focus is passed to the supergroup or superfeed (applies to iPhone version too)
- groups now observe the "Show read" setting (hiding groups with no unread when "Show read" is disabled)
- had to single out and neuter crunchbase.com's JavaScript because its `document.write()`'s were causing Firefox to break completely when paging (used after the initial page load `document.write()` replaces the existing document)
- added debug error reporting to `request()`
- updated `get_attrs()` to be case-insensitive by default (specifically to allow `<img SRC="">` in some feeds)
- added https support to the feedlet (be sure to grab the updated Feedlet from your Extras page if you're using SSL)
- Fever now manually removes `<script>` elements (and their contents) before using PHP's native `strip_tags()` (which unhelpfully removes the tag but not the JavaScript code it contained)
- esc keyboard shortcut now also dismisses dialogs (the previous cmd/ctrl+. still works too)
- clicking a contributing link will now mark its item as read (bug fix)
- J keyboard shortcut now loads the next page of items/links when available or skips to the next unread group (like the spacebar shortcut)
- double-quotes are now encoded in exported opml

Feeds that were brought to my attention that now work properly in Fever 1.06:

- http://www.macupdate.com/mommy/macsurferx.xml


## v1.05

NOTE: Be sure to grab the updated Feedlet from your Extras page (accessible in the action menu below the Fever logo) (updated in 1.04)

- rather than reweight links on update Fever now forces a refresh after the update which checks for unweighted feeds and reweights only if necessary (which should achieve the same thing only with a user-visible progress indicator)
- removed PHP5-only `include_object` argument from `debug_backtrace()` calls


## v1.04

- updated feedlet to work on protected urls and actual feeds and to sniff out likely `a.hrefs` in the absence of proper feed links
- updated `normalize_url()` to work with `feed://` urls
- added title attribute to "Add link to blacklist" and "Toggle item save state" icons
- revised how Hot links are calculated (to better prevent Hot spamming) and sorted (subscribed-to items before unknown links)
- added ?unorphan query command to delete orphaned items and links (these will occasionally be created when deleting a feed during a refresh)
- uncommented login errors (not sure why those were commented out)
- added extra steps to prevent encoded entities inside pre and code elements from being decoded
- introduced more robust error reporting (initial messages may appear out of sequential order)
- stalled, incomplete browser-based refreshes now resume after 30 seconds
- fixed bug in up/down arrow key behavior that prevented keyboarding to the Hot, Saved, Sparks and Search section
- added some housekeeping code to optimize the item and link tables every 24 hours and check (and repair if necessary) for crashed tables once an hour
- swapped the J/K keyboard shortcuts (they were backwards as originally introduced)

Feeds that were brought to my attention that now work properly in Fever 1.04:

- http://daringfireball.net/index.xml (all versions)


## v1.03

- added J/K keyboard shortcuts for scrolling to previous/next item (similar to spacebar without the page up/down behavior for longer items)
- updated Feedlet options dialog to prevent long feed titles from overlapping tabs
- removed confusing text regarding importing an OPML from the Extras page
- bumped the memory saving arbitrary 40 item parse limit up to 100 because even though some sites insist on keeping their entire archive in their feed they don't have the common courtesy to sort them reverse chronologically
- fixed bug in OMDOMDOM that caused the parser to trip up when unencoded CDATA was found inside of a `<content:encoded>` node
- added an "anonymize referrers from this Fever installation" preference under Behavior (currently uses http://feedafever.com/anon/?go=%s)
- fixed bug where feeds with no unread weren't being listed in the feed list on search results (MobileSafari version)
- Firefox should now download exported OPMLs
- selected group now scrolls into view (if necessary) when using keyboard shortcuts

- added :focus styles for various inputs
- made groups independently scrollable (preliminary, still a bit twitchy, will revisit)
- added shift+up/down arrow key commands to select the contributing items of a hot link, right arrow key to open


## v1.01

- fixed bug where feeds with no unread weren't being listed in the feed list on search results
- added ?flush query command to completely wipe any potentially corrupt data while preserving groups, feeds, settings and saved items
- fixed a bug that could result in incorrect temperature fluctuations every other refresh and missing discussion

- fixed some HTML entity encoding issues when editing group and feed titles
- MobileSafari now respects the "mark items as read as they scroll past" preference
- added "toggle item excerpts on click" preference (default behavior remains the same)
- if the groups list is taller than the window groups and feeds will scroll with the page (this is just a stopgap until I can implement a feeds list-like solution)

- collapsing an expanded, scrolled item now scrolls the top of the item back into view
- added check for GD and PNG support before trying to convert favicons
- improved support for extended character sets
- improved OMDOMDOM's handling of CDATA
- OMDOMDOM can now parse UTF-16 with a BOM (unresolved oddity: the initial open angle bracket turns into a diagonal backslash)
- the ?errors query command is now inherited by subrequests (and as a result, actually useful now)
- added support for `https://` to `request.php` (now supports Gmail feeds)
- fixed a tag matching bug in OMDOMDOM
